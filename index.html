          <p class="card-text">I am a Full Stack Developer with a biomedical and software engineering background. I recently graduated from UT Austin with a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development that developed new skills such as React.js, MongoDB, jQuery and more. Including my past certifications in Javascript and Python, I also have experience in programming mobile applications (XCode, Unity) as well as hardware devices (Arduino, Raspberry Pi). </p>
          <br> 
          <p>My past projects include Mole Lens (skin cancer detecting mobile app) as well as an EMG Prosthetic Claw using Arduino. My passion is to develop beautiful web and mobile applications that positively change our world. I am excited to utilize my Full Stack toolset as well as my past engineering skills to leave a lasting impact on this world through software.</p></p>
          <br>
          <p>When I'm not working on software, some of my favorite pastimes include playing chess, poker, badminton, and binge watching just about anything.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I am excited to utilize my skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team. Please contact me with any questions and offers. I can't wait to start our project together!</p>
